# Quantum Options Anomaly Detection Research System (QOADRS)

## 🚀 What This System Does

QOADRS is a quantum-enhanced machine learning platform that analyzes options markets to detect trading anomalies and generate actionable research insights. The system processes real-time options data from S&P 500 stocks and uses quantum computing algorithms to identify patterns that traditional models miss.

## ⚡ Core Technology

### 🔬 Quantum Autoencoder Architecture
The heart of QOADRS is a **6-qubit quantum autoencoder** that uses quantum superposition and entanglement to process options market data. Unlike classical autoencoders, the quantum version can explore multiple data states simultaneously, enabling detection of subtle market anomalies that would be invisible to traditional analysis.

### 🔀 SWAP Test Implementation
The system implements **quantum SWAP tests** to measure similarity between different market states. This quantum algorithm provides a more sensitive measure of market anomalies by comparing the quantum fidelity of different options patterns. When market conditions deviate from normal patterns, the SWAP test triggers anomaly alerts.

### 📊 Enhanced Feature Extraction
QOADRS processes **12 key features** from each options contract:
- Moneyness and implied volatility relationships
- Time decay patterns and Greeks sensitivity
- Volume and open interest anomalies
- Bid-ask spread irregularities

The quantum processor encodes these features into quantum states, allowing the system to detect non-linear relationships that classical models cannot capture.

## 📈 Market Analysis Capabilities

### 🎯 Real-Time Anomaly Detection
The system continuously monitors options markets and identifies:
- **Unusual implied volatility patterns**
- **Abnormal volume spikes** relative to open interest
- **Mispriced options** based on quantum-calculated fair values
- **Sector rotation signals** through cross-asset analysis

### 🧠 Sentiment Analysis Integration
QOADRS combines options flow data with market sentiment indicators:
- **Put/call ratio analysis** across multiple timeframes
- **Fear & Greed index calculations** based on volatility patterns
- **Institutional flow detection** through volume-weighted metrics
- **Market regime classification** using quantum clustering

### 📋 Professional Research Generation
The system automatically generates comprehensive research reports including:
- **Weekly market analysis** with quantitative insights
- **Sector opportunity rankings** with confidence scores
- **Risk assessment dashboards** with multi-dimensional analysis
- **Individual stock anomaly reports** with trading recommendations

## 🌟 Quantum Advantage

### ⚛️ Why Quantum Computing Matters for Options
Options markets are inherently quantum-like systems where multiple outcomes exist simultaneously until expiration. Traditional models struggle with the high-dimensional nature of options data, but quantum algorithms naturally handle:
- **Superposition** of multiple market states
- **Entangled relationships** between different strikes and expirations
- **Quantum interference effects** that reveal hidden correlations
